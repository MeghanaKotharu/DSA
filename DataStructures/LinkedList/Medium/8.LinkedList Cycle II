Given the head of a linked list, return the node where the cycle begins. If there is no cycle, return null.
Note:Pos won't be given to us.

Example1:
head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
Output: tail connects to node index 1

Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the second node.

Approach:
1.When there is a cycle fast and slow will be equal sometime so when they become equal we need to find out the 
node where cycle begins
2.for that we make the fast to head again and move both of them only once.
3.The position at which they will meet will be the start of loop

Solution:
public class Solution {
    public ListNode detectCycle(ListNode head) {
        ListNode slow = head;
        ListNode fast = head;        
        while (fast!=null && fast.next!=null){
            fast = fast.next.next;
            slow = slow.next;                    
            if (fast == slow){
                fast= head; 
                while (fast != slow){
                    slow = slow.next;
                    fast = fast.next;
                }
                return fast;
            }
        }
        return null;
    }
}
