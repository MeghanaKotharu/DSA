**Approach of a Variable Size SW**
Variable size sliding window motto


             1. first of all add elements according to condition.
             2.check if condition is true if yes store solution
             3.Try to achieve one solution first then optimize it by incrementing I slowly once condition is  false then exit loop(store optimal answer before exiting)             
            4.If condition is false in step3 keep on incrementing j again and repeat from step2.
Incase before having optimal solution if string reached end then later with an another loop find optimal solution

**Longest Subarray with sum==k**
we use hashing
